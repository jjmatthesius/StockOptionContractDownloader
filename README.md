# StockOptionContractDownloader
An application to download option contract pricing


Update: 9/6/2016: 
The Yahoo API is not as friendly to work with and I am developing a similar application using the google.finance API using C# on the .NET platform

The only downside to using google.finance that I see is that it does not seem to support weekly options.

This project will be developed to store option pricing in a SQL database and possibly an Access database.
This project will also be developed to perform Black Scholes practitioners volatility modeling.
